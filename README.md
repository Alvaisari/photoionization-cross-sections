# Introduction

This repository contains a Colab notebook that estimates photoionization cross-sections based on the ELETTRA synchrotron database.
Photoionization cross-sections are widely used in XPS spectra analysis for the normalization of the photoelectron signal.

Further details are available in the notebook.
